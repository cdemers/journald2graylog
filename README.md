# journald2graylog
Command line tool to help forward _systemd's_ _journald's_ logs to a [_Graylog_](https://www.graylog.org/) server taking advantage of the descriptive _GELF_ format.

The _journald2graylog_ command expects it's paramters to be provided as the environment variables, making it well suited for [_Docker_](https://www.docker.com/) or _systemd_ driven environments, and PaaS platforms like [_Heroku_](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Usage

To use _journald2graylog_, you simply pipe the output of _journalctl_, while enabling it's _JSON_ output format, into the _jourald2graylog_ command.  It can be as simple this: `journalctl -o json | journald2graylog`, but usually you will require and want to provide more parameters.

Note that _journald2graylog_ **only supports UDP** for now, having TCP might be cool, but it's not in our short term plans.

There are only three configuration parameters:
* The `J2G_HOSTNAME` is the hostname or IP of your _Graylog_ server, it will default to locahost.
* The `J2G_PORT` is the port of the **UDP GELF** input of the _Graylog_ server, it will default to `12201`, but this value will almost always differ depending on your _Graylog_ configuration, so you will most likely have to look it up in your own _Graylog_ server.
* The `J2G_PACKET_SIZE` is the maximum size of the TCP/IP packets you can use between the source (_journald2graylg_) and the destination (your _Graylog_ server). This will vary depending on your network capabilities, but the default value of _1420_ will be appropriate in the vast majority of situations.

### Example usage
This example uses all three available configuration parameters, provided as environment variables:

```
export J2G_HOSTNAME=graylog.example.com
export J2G_PORT=12201
export J2G_PACKET_SIZE=1420
sudo journalctl -o json -f | journald2graylog 
```
Or you can simply do:

```
journalctl -o json -f | J2G_HOSTNAME=graylog.example.com journald2graylog 
```
And depending on your context, you might actually need to use something more among the line of:

```
sudo journalctl -o json -f | J2G_HOSTNAME=graylog.example.com ./journald2graylog
```

## Install

From source, you will have to already have a working _go_ development environment setup, with a proper _GOPATH_.

```
go get github.com/robertkowalski/graylog-golang
go get github.com/cdemers/journald2graylog
```

From binary, you can download the latest precompiled binary (Linux AMD64) from the [release section](https://github.com/cdemers/journald2graylog/releases).
